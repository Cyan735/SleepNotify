# SleepNotify

### This plugin Notifies you when:

#### - It turns nighttime or a thunderstorm starts:
    "You can go to sleep now"

#### - A player goes to bed:
    "<Player> went to bed (Sleeping players/Total players needed to sleep)" 

Note: Messages only get send to players in the Overworld as that is the only dimension players can sleep in
